1. Decision Trees (DT):
Decision Trees are supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They learn simple decision rules from the data to predict the target variable.

* Applications: Decision Trees are widely used in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and marketing.
* Advantages: Easy to interpret and visualize, can handle both numerical and categorical data.
* Example: Classification of customer churn in a telecom company.

2. Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They find the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space.

* Applications: Image classification, text classification, and bioinformatics.
* Advantages: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, memory-efficient.
* Example: Classification of handwritten digits in image data.

3. Support Vector Regression (SVR):
Support Vector Regression is a variant of SVM used for regression tasks. It predicts continuous target variables by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between data points and the hyperplane.

 * Applications: Stock price prediction, house price prediction, and time series forecasting.
 * Advantages: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, robust to outliers.
 * Example: Prediction of house prices based on features like area, location, and number of rooms.

4. Clustering Algorithms:
Clustering algorithms are unsupervised learning techniques used to group similar data points together based on their features.
  * Types: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN.
  * Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and image segmentation.
 * Example: Grouping similar products based on customer purchasing behavior.

5. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):
Multi-Layer Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network composed of multiple layers of nodes (neurons) that can learn complex patterns in the data.

* Applications: Image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
* Advantages: Can learn non-linear relationships, powerful for complex tasks.
* Example: Classification of images into different categories.

6. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Principal Component Analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique used to reduce the number of features in the data while preserving its variance.

* Applications: Data visualization, noise reduction, and feature extraction.
* Advantages: Reduces dimensionality, removes correlated features.
* Example: Visualizing high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.
